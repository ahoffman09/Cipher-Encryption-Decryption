# Cipher Encryption/Decryption
This is one of my most recent projects - it is one I did as a project for the Data Structures course I am taking. 

It is a shorter program that I think captures the C++ language nicely, and in the process I learned how to use VS Code and the terminal pretty well. This project is meant as an encryption and decryption program for two different methods of encryption: the classic Ceasar cipher encryption, and a random substitution cipher encryption. This program also includes a list of options, utilizing input from the user, to decide what the goal is in running the program. Sort of like a website directly in your computer!

Here is a screenshot of the "app" in use:
